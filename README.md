# How to run the program(s)

* Install file from .zip
* Make Sure pip is added to PATH
*Â Run setup.py if you don't have the required modules
* Run `autoViews.py` `TikTokBot.py` or equivalent

<b>If you don't already know how to make a Python virtual enviornment, please keep reading.</b>
```
mkdir my-new-python-project
cd my-new-python-project
virtualenv --python=python(your-python-version) venv *No parenthesis*
```
This will now create a my-new-python-project/venv folder
```
touch .gitignore
subl .gitignore
```
Adds the virtual env to your .gitignore
Whenever you'd like to re-run the program, you have to activate the enviornment:
```
lsvirtualenv - List all of your enviornments.
cd my-new-python-project
source venv/bin/activate
```
Once your virtual enviornment is activated, if you haven't already run setup.py, you need install the reqired libraries.
```
pip install requests
pip install threading
pip install selenium
pip install etc. etc.
```
*Once you do this you'll finally be good to go!*

# To-Do's:

- [ ] Add GUI to the script so that threads can be user limited.
- [ ] Re-Do TikTokBot.py so that the user can do each ReCaptcha on each opening of a tab.
- [ ] Implement the multiprocessing module for the ability to trigger two ports at once
- [x] Complete Documentation
- [ ] Add captcha bypass in selenium version
- [x] Create a system for scraping proxies from the [freeproxylist.net](freeproxylist.net) website
- [x] Incooperate another bot object, that runs inline with the main bot to store time data.
- [x] Finish refactoring the old share bot print/input statements. 
- [x] Re-Write some of the methods in the TikTok class to GET the users content.
- [x] Create a new  timer  class which holds the time_remaining/time_start method(s).
- [x] Create new proxy class that stores the proxy data as an object for the bot to be used/read.
